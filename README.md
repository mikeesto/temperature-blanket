# 2021 Temperature Blanket

Inspired by knitted/crocheted temperature blankets that have a row for every day of the year. The colour of the row corresponds to the temperature outside. This digital temperature blanket is for Brisbane, Australia.

GitHub Actions are used to retrieve and store the daily temperature without needing to use a database. I found out about this useful trick from [Swyx's blog post](https://www.swyx.io/github-scraping/).
